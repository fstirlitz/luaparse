# luaparse

A Lua parser written in JavaScript, originally written by Oskar Schöldström for his bachelor's thesis at Arcada.

## Installation

Install through `npm install luaparse`.

## Usage

CommonJS

```js
var parser = require('luaparse');
var ast = parser.parse('i = 0');
console.log(JSON.stringify(ast));
```

AMD

```js
require(['luaparse'], function(parser) {
  var ast = parser.parse('i = 0');
  console.log(JSON.stringify(ast));
});
```

Browser

```html
<script src="luaparse.js"></script>
<script>
var ast = luaparse.parse('i = 0');
console.log(JSON.stringify(ast));
</script>
```

## Parser Interface

Basic usage:

```js
luaparse.parse(code, options);
```

The output of the parser is an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) formatted in JSON.

The available options are:

- `wait: false` Explicitly tell the parser when the input ends.
- `comments: true` Store comments as an array in the chunk object.
- `scope: false` Track identifier scopes.
- `locations: false` Store location information on each syntax node.
- `ranges: false` Store the start and end character locations on each syntax
  node.
- `onCreateNode: null` A callback which will be invoked when a syntax node
  has been completed. The node which has been created will be passed as the
  only parameter.
- `onCreateScope: null` A callback which will be invoked when a new scope is
  created.
- `onDestroyScope: null` A callback which will be invoked when the current
  scope is destroyed.
- `onLocalDeclaration: null` A callback which will be invoked when a local
  variable is declared. The identifier will be passed as the only parameter.
- `luaVersion: '5.1'` The version of Lua the parser will target; supported
  values are `'5.1'`, `'5.2'`, `'5.3'` and `'LuaJIT'`.
- `extendedIdentifiers: false` Whether to allow code points ≥ U+0080 in
  identifiers, like LuaJIT does. **Note:** setting `luaVersion: 'LuaJIT'`
  currently does *not* enable this option; this may change in the future.
- `encodingMode: 'none'` Defines the relation between code points ≥ U+0080
  appearing in parser input and raw bytes in source code, and how Lua escape
  sequences in JavaScript strings should be interpreted. See the
  [Encoding modes](#encoding-modes) section below for more information.

The default options are also exposed through `luaparse.defaultOptions` where
they can be overriden globally.

There is a second interface which might be preferable when using the `wait`
option.

```js
var parser = luaparse.parse({ wait: true });
parser.write('foo = "');
parser.write('bar');
var ast = parser.end('"');
```

This would be identical to:

```js
var ast = luaparse.parse('foo = "bar"');
```

### AST format

If the following code is executed:

```js
luaparse.parse('foo = "bar"');
```

then the returned value will be:

```js
{
  "type": "Chunk",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "AssignmentStatement",
      "variables": [
        {
          "type": "Identifier",
          "name": "foo"
        }
      ],
      "init": [
        {
          "type": "StringLiteral",
          "value": "bar",
          "raw": "\"bar\""
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "comments": []
}
```

### Encoding modes

Unlike strings in JavaScript, Lua strings are not Unicode strings, but
bytestrings (sequences of 8-bit values); likewise, implementations of Lua
parse the source code as a sequence of octets. However, the input to this
parser is a JavaScript string, i.e. a sequence of 16-bit code units (not
necessarily well-formed UTF-16). This poses a problem of how those code
units should be interpreted, particularly if they are outside the Basic
Latin block ('ASCII').

The `encodingMode` option specifies how these issues should be handled.
Possible values are as follows:

- `'none'`: Source code characters all pass through as-is and string
  literals are not interpreted at all; the string literal nodes contain
  the value `null`. This is the default mode. Use it when you are not
  interested in the concrete values of Lua string literals.
- `'x-user-defined'`: Source code has been decoded with the WHATWG
  `x-user-defined` encoding; escapes of bytes in the range \[0x80, 0xff]
  are mapped to the Unicode range \[U+F780, U+F7FF]. Use this mode to parse
  files decoded with the WHATWG [`TextDecoder`] API.
- `'pseudo-latin1'`: Source code has been decoded with the IANA
  `iso-8859-1` encoding; escapes of bytes in the range \[0x80, 0xff]
  are mapped to Unicode range \[U+0080, U+00FF]. Note that this is
  **not** the same as how WHATWG standards define the `iso-8859-1`
  encoding, which is to say, as a synonym of `windows-1252`. Use this mode
  to interoperate with an API like [`readAsBinaryString`], [`atob`] or
  [`Buffer`].
- `'utf-8-lossy'`: Source code has been decoded as UTF-8. Use this mode
  when you expect most string literals to be UTF-8, but do not require
  exact faithful representation in all circumstances.

### Custom AST

The default AST structure is somewhat inspired by the Mozilla Parser API but
can easily be overriden to customize the structure or to inject custom logic.

`luaparse.ast` is an object containing all functions used to create the AST, if
you for example wanted to trigger an event on node creations you could use the
following:

```js
var luaparse = require('luaparse'),
    events = new (require('events').EventEmitter);

Object.keys(luaparse.ast).forEach(function(type) {
  var original = luaparse.ast[type];
  luaparse.ast[type] = function() {
    var node = original.apply(null, arguments);
    events.emit(node.type, node);
    return node;
  };
});
events.on('Identifier', function(node) { console.log(node); });
luaparse.parse('i = "foo"');
```

_this is only an example to illustrate what is possible and this particular
example might not suit your needs as the end location of the node has not been
determined yet. If you desire events you should use the `onCreateNode` callback
instead)._


### Lexer

The lexer used by luaparse can be used independently of the recursive descent
parser. The lex function is exposed as `luaparse.lex()` and it will return the
next token up until `EOF` is reached.

Each token consists of:

- `type` expressed as an enum flag which can be matched with `luaparse.tokenTypes`.
- `value`
- `line`, `lineStart`
- `range` can be used to slice out raw values, eg. `foo = "bar"` will return a
`StringLiteral` token with the value `bar`. Slicing out the range on the other
hand will return `"bar"`.

```js
var parser = luaparse.parse('foo = "bar"', { wait: true });
parser.lex(); // { type: 8, value: "foo", line: 1, lineStart: 0, range: [0, 3] }
parser.lex(); // { type: 32, value: "=", line: 1, lineStart: 0, range: [4, 5]}
parser.lex(); // { type: 2, value: "bar", line: 1, lineStart: 0, range: [6, 11] }
parser.lex(); // { type: 1, value: "<eof>", line: 1, lineStart: 0, range: [11 11] }
parser.lex(); // { type: 1, value: "<eof>", line: 1, lineStart: 0, range: [11 11] }
```

{"type":"Chunk","body":[{"type":"AssignmentStatement","variables":[{"type":"Identifier","name":"i"}],"init":[{"type":"NumericLiteral","value":0,"raw":"0"}]}],"comments":[]}
```

## Support

Has been tested in at least IE6+, Firefox 3+, Safari 4+, Chrome 10+, Opera 10+,
Node 0.4.0+, RingoJS 0.8-0.9, Rhino 1.7R4-1.7R5, Nashorn 1.8.0.

## Quality Assurance

_TL;DR simply run `make qa`. This will run all quality assurance scripts but
assumes you have it set up correctly._

Begin by cloning the repository and installing the development dependencies
with `npm install`.

The luaparse test suite uses [testem](https://github.com/airportyh/testem) as a
test runner, and because of this it's very easy to run the tests using
different javascript engines or even on locally installed browsers.

### Test runners

- `make test` uses node.
- `make testem-engines` uses node, ringo and rhino
1.7R5. This requires that you have the engines installed.
- `make test-node` uses a custom command line reporter to make the output
easier on the eyes while practicing TDD.
- By installing `testem` globally you can also run the tests in a locally
installed browser.

### Other quality assurance measures

- You can check the function complexity using [complexity-report](https://github.com/philbooth/complexityReport.js)
using `make complexity-analysis`
- Running `make coverage` will generate the [coverage report](https://fstirlitz.github.io/luaparse/coverage.html).
To simply check that all code has coverage you can run `make coverage-analysis`.
- `make lint`, `make benchmark`, `make profile`.

### Documentation

By running `make docs` all [documentation](https://fstirlitz.github.io/luaparse/)
will be generated.
